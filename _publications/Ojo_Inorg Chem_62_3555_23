excerpt: 'The thermal and electronic properties of Ba2MnSe3 are reported for the first time. Analysis of the temperature-dependent thermal properties reveals a low speed of sound and an intrinsic low thermal conductivity for this relatively large band gap material. The low speed and Debye temperature suggest weak bonding that leads to enhanced phonon scattering resulting in a low thermal conductivity. Our findings improve our understanding of the fundamental properties of this ternary chalcogenide.'
